I have this project folder now i want to maintain the 
history of this project using git.
The entire history(I create a new file, make changes, delete some file)
all history gets stored in .git(git-repositry(folder))
.file All are hidden
so for that initilaize a empty git repositry(folder)
After intialzing .git folder gets created in project folder
so all the changes we are going to make in the project
folder will be tracked by this .git folder i.e hidden

we can see this hidden folder by -> ls -a

Now we will be able to maintain the history of this project directory any change made in this project now git will pick it up

touch file.txt
 git status will show
 git status(these are the changes that are not currently in the history of this project)
 A file.txt has been added and it is currently untracked


 1->
 mkdir project
 cd project
touch file.txt
git status
git add .
git commit -m "my-first-commit"
