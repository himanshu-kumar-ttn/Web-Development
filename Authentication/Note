Authentication Routes

Using an MVC (model, view & controller) approach

Auth Routes
/signup  get  sign up page  // return us the signup form in which we will add the form details
/login   get  log in page
/signup  post create a new user in db // post request to submit signup form detail to the database
/login   post authenticate a current user  //post request to authenticate a current user after they fill up in the login 
page press submit that sends a post request to the server to take those login detail check them against those stored in the
  database and then logged them in 
/logout  get  log a user out

if we send a post request from a browser its normally after a user submitted some kind of form
so when they click on submit a post request is send to the server but they also send with that 
post request the data they entered in the form username or email

json data ->

{
    "email": 'himani@supii.com',
    "password": 'kyubataye'
}

//middleware
app.use(express.json());

takes any json data that comes along with a request parses into 
a javascript object for us so we can use it inside the code

create a new schema 

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true
        unique: true
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minLength: 6,
    },
})

const user = mongoose.model('user', userSchema)
