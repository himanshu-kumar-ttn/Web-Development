NoSql data make use of collection and documents

NoSql databases are split in collection(more like table in sql databases)

Each collection can be use to store a particular type of data

So the blog collection will only store blog document

Each collection should contain only one type of document

document represent single item of data

From our code we can connect to a collection like a blogs in the
mongodb so we can either save update delete documents inside it

Mongoose

Mongoose is an ODM library - Object Document Mapping library

Mongoose -
user model -> User.get(), User.findById()
Blog model -> Blog.deleteOne()

The way we generally work with monogDB and mongoose is to create schemas and models 

Schemas -> Defines the structure of a type of data/document properties & property types


user schema:                      Blog schema
name(String), required            title(string), required
age(number)                       ...
bio(String), required              ..

Models -> Allow us to communicate with database collections

Blog Schema -> get, save, delete, etc  -> Database Blog Collection

npm install mongoose

Blogs - collection, 

We're using the model to create a new instance of a blog document withing the code and in here we pass an object with the different properties of this blog,
Inside our schema each blog have a title which is a string a snippet which is a string and also a body which is a string
we dont have to pass this mongoose automatically takes care of the timestamps for us 

underthe hood mongoose is gonna say okay we have used the blog model therefore i am going to look for blogs collection
based on this name and
