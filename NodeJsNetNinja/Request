This type of requests are typically to get a resource from the
server whether that be JSON data from the database or webpage

GET -> To get data from the server, requests to get a resource
POST -> requests to create a new data (e.g new blog)
DELETE -> requests to delete data (e.g delete a blog)
PUT -> requests to update exisit ng data (e.g update a blog)

when we have a web form and when we submit then we send a post 
request to the server with that new data and it can be added to the
database

we can use same routes for different type of request
different request can be handled differently from each other on the server


<form action='/blogs' method="POST">
<label for='title'>Blog Title:</label>
<input type='text' id='title' name='title' require>
<button>Submit<button/>
