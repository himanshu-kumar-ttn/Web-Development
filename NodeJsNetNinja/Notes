In node we get access to the global object with several different methods
and properties attached to it that we can use out of the box

Window object inside the browser is the browser's global object 

In node our global object is not window but global and that represents
the global context in a node environment

console.log(global)

global.setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('In the timeout)
}, 3000)

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('In the timeout)
    clearInterval(int);
}, 3000)

const int = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('In the interval)
}, 1000)
